## Overview 
Law and order has always been a huge topic in U.S. politics, with presidents declaring war on crimes and painting the society as increasingly unsafe and violent. However, is it based on facts or just plain fear-mongering? What are the cities whose crime rate increased or decreased drastically? This visualization app allows you to see the trend of various kind of violent crimes( rape, homicide, robbery, assualt) across different U.S. cities. 













## Usage scenario

John is a political scientist studying the trend of various crimes in major U.S. cities in order to provide policy advice to law makers. He first can [select] a particular crime of interest, for example rape, then he can [visualize] the average rate of that crime of all U.S. cities in a given time span. If he wish to see the trend of a particular city, he can [select] that city and see its crime rate for the type of crime he selected. Furthermore, he can [compare] the crime rate trend of that city with the national average or with another city. Based on this comparasion, he can identify the cities whose crime rate trends diverage drastically with the national trend and find association between municipal/state policy and crime rate.
